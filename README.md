# Resumod
#### Making JSON Resume pretty on iOS

---

### Goals:
* Create a fun and interactive way to view a resume
* Learn and share knowledge of Swift
* Be corrected by the everyone when I make a horrendously embarrassing mistake in Swift
* Try to use little to no third party libraries

### Structure:
* Proper classing and true OOP
* Singleton for global data storage and netowrk connections (I may change this down the road)
* Closures instead of delegates for most callbacks

### Links and such:
* JSON Resume: http://jsonresume.org/
* Shameless plug for The East Troy Computer Club: http://www.meetup.com/East-Troy-Computer-Club/
